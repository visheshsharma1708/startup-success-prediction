✅ Startup Success Prediction Using Linear Regression
🚀 Problem Statement
This project aims to predict the profit of a startup based on key financial inputs such as R&D Spend, Administration Cost, Marketing Spend, and State. It's a real-world scenario where investors want to estimate how profitable a startup can be based on its initial expenditures and location. The project demonstrates how linear regression can be used to build a simple yet effective predictive model for startup analysis.

✅ Why This Project is Unique & Valuable
This is a real-world investment analysis use case that walks through the complete machine learning pipeline, including:

Handling categorical variables (State)

Performing feature scaling

Splitting data into training and test sets

Training a Linear Regression model

Evaluating using regression metrics

Saving the model using Pickle for reuse

Optional: Feature selection to improve model clarity

Beautiful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Optional: Add Streamlit app to make it interactive for users or clients

📁 Dataset
The dataset used is 50_Startups.csv, which contains 50 startup records with the following columns:

R&D Spend

Administration

Marketing Spend

State (Categorical)

Profit (Target)
